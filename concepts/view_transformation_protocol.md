The View Transformation Protocol is a way to represent view rendering as a set
of instructions that can later be applied to the view template. Pakyow
implements this protocol on the backend for initial rendering and in [Ring](https://github.com/pakyow/ring) for
client-side rendering.

Let's look at an example. Here's the view template:

```html
<div data-scope="post">
  <p data-prop="content">
    content here
  </p>
</div>
```

Here's some example rendering code:

```ruby
data = []
data << { id: 1, content: 'one' }
data << { id: 2, content: 'two' }
data << { id: 3, content: 'three' }

view.scope(:post).apply(data)
```

The view rendering can be represented by this bit of JSON:

```json
[]
```

Once applied to the template, the view is effectively rendered:

```html
<div data-scope="post" data-id="1">
  <p data-prop="content">
    one
  </p>
</div>

<div data-scope="post" data-id="2">
  <p data-prop="content">
    two
  </p>
</div>

<div data-scope="post" data-id="3">
  <p data-prop="content">
    three
  </p>
</div>
```

Notice that the underlying knowledge of state is preserved in the rendered view.
This allows for future rendering instructions to be applied to the view without
starting from scratch each time.

The View Transformation Protocol implements the full View API as described here:
