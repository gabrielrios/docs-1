desc: Build a prototype with HTML and CSS.
---

Pakyow lets you quickly build a prototype writing only HTML and CSS.  This
reduces the effort required to get a feature to a point that you can see and
interact with it right in your web browser. Less up-front effort means less
commitment, so you can play more without feeling like you're wasting time.

Later, you can add backend functionality on top of the prototype without losing
any previous work. This process is enabled by view-first development, which
separates the concerns of presentation and logic.

Pakyow jump starts your project and keeps it moving forward.
